This Java program simulates an elevator's movement within a building. It takes the total number of floors, the current floor, and a sequence of actions (U for up, D for down) from the user, then updates the current floor accordingly while ensuring movements are within valid bounds. The program provides feedback on the final floor after processing all actions, including handling edge cases like invalid inputs and movements out of bounds.
